This is a simple web application which supports two main functionalities:
- Adding New XML RSS Feed
- Viewing Saved XML RSS Feeds

User can add feed URL and name, see list of feeds, view feed information and read articles.

For this project I used Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring MVC. For MCV views design JSP pages were used, simple CSS (incl. Bootstrap). ORM Framework - Hibernate.
